          <h1>Program overview</h1>
          <p>
            The mission of the CoW Grants Program is to provide funding to help grow CoW Protocolâ€™s ecosystem. For this, CoW Protocol is dedicating 600K <a href="https://gnosisscan.io/token/0xe91d153e0b41518a2ce8dd3d7944fa863463a97d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wXDAI</a> and 600K <a href="https://gnosisscan.io/token/0x177127622c4a00f3d409b75571e12cb3c8973d3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COW</a> tokens worth of funds for the first 6 months of the grants being live.
          </p><p>
            The primary areas of growth for CoW Protocol under this proposal are defined as:

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>CoWmunity growth</li>
            <li>User interface and user experience (UI/UX)</li>
            <li>Decentralization</li>
            <li>Solver development</li>
            <li>Developer tools (SDK)</li>
            <li>Integrations and protocol order flow</li>
            <li>Other/misc</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The judgment criteria for the grant applications will be based on the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Feasibility - Is the grant feasible to do at this moment or does the grant require upgrades in the protocol layer or overall ecosystem?</li>
            <li>Impact for the CoW ecosystem - How much of a positive impact will this grant have to the overall CoW Protocol ecosystem?</li>
            <li>Sanity - Is the amount of workload required for this grant accurate?&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Technical expertise of the grantee/s - Does the grantee have the technical expertise to deliver the grant milestones?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0xdc641be107f139753cea051f1bacb8b74b915713a95306c3994f5e03e20d6bef" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIP-8 lays out</a>, the CoW Grants Program Safe is managed by two different multi-signature wallets. Safe #3 is shared with the CoW DAO (Safe #1) and the Grants Committee (Safe #2). Safe #3 holds all the grant funds. You can check the governing process in the image below:

          <h3>Application Process:</h3>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Initial public application</strong><br />

                Anyone can submit an application to the CoW Grants Program. They just need to use the <Link href="/apply">grant application form</Link> and follow the instructions in the <Link href="/faq">FAQ</Link>
                <br /><br /></li>
              <li><strong>Application review</strong><br />

                The committee is not obligated to move a specific proposal to the review stage and will do so based on its sole discretion
                <br /><br /></li>
              <li><strong>Committee feedback</strong><br />

                After the committee reviews applications, the following outcomes are possible:
                <ul>
                  <li>The committee finds the application a successful and approves the grant</li>
                  <li>The committee denies the grant, and that is the end of the process</li>
                  <li>The committee meets with the grant applicant and reworks the application together with the applicant to ensure it aligns well with CGP goals. Once updated, the application may be reconsidered</li>
                </ul><br />
              </li>

              <li><strong>Grant approval</strong><br />

                The CoW Grants Program Committee will show preference toward successful grants in a public forum poll where all committee members are required to vote before moving a grant to its final stage
                <br /><br /></li>
              <li><strong>Grant structuring &amp; management</strong><br />

                Once the grant is approved, the committee will outline a series of milestones to be achieved to obtain full funding. Grantees will be compensated for reaching each milestone, successively, and &ndash; if they are not achieved &ndash; the CoW Grants Committee reserves the right to close the grant or stop payment until specific milestones are achieved
              </li>
            </ol>
